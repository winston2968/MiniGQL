  (* State of the program, essentially a graph structure and a binding in form of a table,
  and as convenience info an overapproximation of the maximal node number
  allocated in the graph (could in principle be recomputed each time)
  Nodes have a unique identifier (an int) which is incremented when creating new nodes.
  When deleting nodes, the max node number is currently not decremented, 
  thus does not reflect the number of nodes in the graph, but one could think
  of a garbage collector when running out of node identifiers.

   a heading (variable list 'v list) and a list of lines containing nodes 
   that each have the same length as the variable list  *)
